            A photovoltaic power plant harnesses solar energy to generate electricity. It consists of solar panels composed of photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight directly into electricity through the photovoltaic effect.<br><br>
            Here's a quick rundown of how it works: <br>When sunlight hits the PV cells, the photons in the light knock electrons free from atoms within the cells, generating a flow of electricity. This electricity is then captured and converted into a usable form through inverters, ready for distribution to the grid or for direct use.
