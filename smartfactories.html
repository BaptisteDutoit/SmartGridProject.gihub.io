         <div class="content">
            Smart factories utilize advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics to optimize manufacturing processes. 
<br><br>These technologies enable real-time monitoring and analysis of production data, allowing for predictive maintenance, automated quality control, and efficient resource management. 
<br><br>By connecting machines, devices, and systems, smart factories streamline operations, reduce downtime, and increase productivity, ultimately driving innovation and competitiveness in the manufacturing industry.

Smart factories play a role in the smart grid by using advanced technology to manage energy efficiently. 
<br><br>They can adjust energy usage based on grid needs and participate in programs to balance energy supply and demand. 
<br><br>This helps make the grid more stable and supports the use of renewable energy sources.
