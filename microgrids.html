            Microgrids are small-scale electrical networks designed to provide reliable power to a small number of consumers. 
            <br><br>They combine local production resources (diesel generators, photovoltaic panels, mini wind turbines), consumption sites, storage devices and demand management and supervision tools.

            They can be directly connected to a distribution grid, or operate independently of the grid in "islanding" mode. 
            <br><br>Deploying a microgrid has a number of objectives: to provide sustainable electricity to so-called non-interconnected areas such as islands, which are not (or only marginally) connected to national grids; to ensure the security of energy supply in areas where the grid is fragile and often unreliable; to facilitate the integration of renewable energies: microgrid energy management systems smooth consumption and regulate the intermittency of renewable energies.
