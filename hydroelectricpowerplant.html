         <div class="content">
            Hydroelectric power is a clean, renewable source of energy that utilizes the kinetic and potential energy of water. <br><br>
            The process begins with water stored in a reservoir or dam at a high elevation. When electricity is needed, gates at the dam open, allowing water to flow through turbines located at a lower elevation.<br><br>
            This flow spins the turbines, which are connected to generators that produce electricity. The amount of electricity generated depends on the volume of water and the height from which it falls, known as the 'head’.

            In a smart grid city, hydroelectric power contributes to a balanced energy mix. It provides a stable base load of energy, while other renewable sources like solar and wind can be integrated to handle peak demands. <br><br>The smart grid’s ability to manage these diverse energy sources makes it a cornerstone of modern, eco-friendly urban development.
