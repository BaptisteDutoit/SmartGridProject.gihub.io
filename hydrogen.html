 Hydrogen production during periods of electricity overproduction offers a promising solution for grid balancing and energy storage. 
<br><br>Electrolysis, a process where electricity splits water into hydrogen and oxygen, can be deployed during times of surplus electricity generation, such as windy or sunny days with high renewable energy output. 
<br><br>This excess electricity can be utilized to produce hydrogen, which can then be stored for later use in fuel cells to generate electricity or power hydrogen-based vehicles, providing a flexible and sustainable energy storage solution.

Hydrogen production during electricity surplus is valuable for smart grids. It converts extra renewable energy into hydrogen, which can be stored and used later. 
<br><br>This helps balance energy supply and demand, supports renewable energy integration, and promotes sustainability by providing a clean fuel option.
