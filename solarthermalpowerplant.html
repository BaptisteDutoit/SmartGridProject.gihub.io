         <div class="content">
           A solar thermal power plant harnesses the sun's energy to generate electricity through the use of mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver. 
<br><br>This receiver contains a fluid, often a heat transfer fluid like molten salt or oil, which absorbs the concentrated sunlight and heats up. The heated fluid is then used to produce steam, which drives a turbine connected to a generator, producing electricity.

Solar thermal power plants are important in a smart grid because they offer a reliable source of renewable energy generation. <br><br>
Their ability to store heat allows for continuous electricity production even when sunlight is unavailable, contributing to grid stability and resilience. <br><br>
Additionally, their integration into the grid helps diversify energy sources, reduce carbon emissions, and promote sustainability in energy production.
