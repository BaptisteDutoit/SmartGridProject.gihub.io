            Smart common buildings are an integral part of smart grid urban spaces, contributing to the overall efficiency and sustainability of cities. <br><br>These buildings are equipped with advanced technologies that allow them to communicate with the electrical grid and other infrastructures, optimizing energy consumption and contributing to the city’s energy management.<br>Here are some key features :<br><br>
            •	Energy Efficiency: Smart buildings are designed to use energy more efficiently, with systems in place to reduce waste and lower costs.<br>
•	Automation: Building management systems automate various functions such as lighting, heating, and cooling, adjusting them based on occupancy and time of day.<br>
•	Renewable Energy Integration: These buildings often incorporate renewable energy sources like solar panels, which can feed excess energy back into the smart grid.<br>
•	Data Analytics: Smart buildings collect data on energy usage patterns, which can be analyzed to further improve efficiency and reduce operational costs.<br>

        Smart common buildings play a crucial role in the smart grid ecosystem. They are not just passive consumers of energy but active participants in the energy network. Through smart meters and management systems, they can respond to grid demands by adjusting energy consumption during peak hours or storing energy during off-peak times. <br><br>This interaction helps balance the load on the grid, preventing outages and ensuring a stable energy supply.
